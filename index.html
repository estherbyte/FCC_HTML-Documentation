                <p>The basic HTML structure is fixed with doctype declaration, html, head, title, and body tags. The
                    content
                    then can be added to the body tag. Tags are enclosed in 'and'. A tag should have an opening tag eg
                    'h1'
                    and a closing tag eg '/h1>''.</p>
                <p>For most elements, the start tag (or opening tag) and end tag (or closing tag) mark the beginning and
                    end
                    of an element, respectively. The opening tag contains the name of the element (in this case, p for
                    paragraph) enclosed in angle brackets</p>
                <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: '!DOCTYPE HTML'</p>

                    we
                    recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac). We

                <p> With text-based HTML editors, the source code can be edited directly.</p>
                <p>There are two types of HTML editors- Text based editors and WYSIWYG(What You See Is What You Get)
                    editors.</p>

                <p>HTML elements can contain formatting instructions, semantic meaning, and content. For example, HTML
                    elements are used to denote document parts such as headers, paragraphs, and footers and to embed
                    content
                    such such as hyperlinks, text, and images</p>
                <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.</p>
                <p>The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag</p>
                <p>Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty
                    elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!</p>

                        Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

                        Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document
                        structure.

                        'h1' headings should be used for main headings, followed by 'h2' headings, then the less
                        important
                        'h3', and so on.</p>
                    <p>Bigger Headings
                        Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the
                        style attribute, using the CSS font-size property</p>
                    <p>A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white
                        space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with
                        H1
                        being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.</p>
                    <p>HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.
